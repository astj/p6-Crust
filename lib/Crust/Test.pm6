=head1 DESCRIPTION

Crust::Test is a port of perl5 Plack::Test.

Crust::Test is a unified interface to test PSGI applications using
L<HTTP::Request> and L<HTTP::Response> objects. It also allows you to run PSGI
applications in various ways. The default backend is C<Crust::Test::MockHTTP>,
but you may also use any L<Crust::Handler> implementation to run live HTTP
requests against a web server.
